# iOS (Swift, ObjC) Client

To run this app, you'll need to first run the sample server locally.
Follow the "How to run locally" instructions in the root directory's README.md to get started.
Once you've started the server, open http://localhost:4242 in your browser to check that the
server is running locally.

After running the sample server:

1. Run `pod install` to install the Stripe iOS SDK.
2. Open `app.xcworkspace`.
3. Build and run the appropriate project (Swift or ObjC) in the iOS simulator.
